# Expo App UI Revamp - Wise-Inspired Design

## Design System Foundation

### Color Palette (Wise-inspired teal)

Primary teal `#00B9A8`, dark variant `#008B82`, light backgrounds with subtle teal tints, charcoal text `#1A1A2E` for maximum readability, secondary accents in warm coral `#FF6B6B` for achievements/alerts.

### Typography

- Use `expo-google-fonts` to install **DM Sans** (clean, modern) for body and **Archivo** for bold headings
- Large, confident numbers for stats (48-64pt)
- Clear hierarchy: titles 28-32pt, subtitles 18-20pt, body 14-16pt

### Core Files to Create/Modify

- `constants/theme.ts` - Complete design token system
- `constants/fonts.ts` - Typography configuration
- `components/ui/` - New component library

---

## Phase 1: Design System Setup

Create comprehensive design tokens in `constants/theme.ts`:

```typescript
export const WiseColors = {
  primary: '#00B9A8',
  primaryDark: '#008B82',
  primaryLight: '#E6FAF8',
  background: '#FAFBFC',
  surface: '#FFFFFF',
  surfaceElevated: '#FFFFFF',
  text: '#1A1A2E',
  textSecondary: '#6B7280',
  success: '#10B981',
  warning: '#F59E0B',
  error: '#EF4444',
  accent: '#FF6B6B',
}
```

Install required fonts via `expo-google-fonts`.

---

## Phase 2: Core UI Components

### New Components to Create

1. **`components/ui/Card.tsx`** - Elevated card with subtle shadows, 16px border-radius, Wise-style hover states
2. **`components/ui/Button.tsx`** - Primary/secondary variants with teal gradients, press animations
3. **`components/ui/ProgressRing.tsx`** - Circular progress for stats (steps, water) with animated fills
4. **`components/ui/Header.tsx`** - Consistent screen headers with greeting and avatar
5. **`components/ui/AnimatedNumber.tsx`** - Animated counting numbers for stat values
6. **`components/ui/AIBackground.tsx`** - Component that fetches/displays AI-generated decorative images

### Refactored Components

- **`StatCard.tsx`** - Redesign with circular progress rings, gradient backgrounds, large bold numbers
- **`StreakBadge.tsx`** - Add flame animations, gradient backgrounds, celebratory effects
- **`GoalProgress.tsx`** - Redesign with milestone markers, completion celebrations

---

## Phase 3: Screen Redesigns

### Dashboard (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)

- Large greeting header with user avatar and AI-generated background
- Featured stat card (primary goal) with circular progress ring
- 2x2 grid of stat cards with Wise-style elevation
- Horizontal scrolling streak badges with animations
- Goals section with visual progress indicators

### Stats (`app/(tabs)/stats.tsx`)

- Weekly chart visualization (bar/line chart using `react-native-svg`)
- Comparison widgets (this week vs last week)
- Animated statistics with large numbers
- Insights section with AI-generated decorative headers

### Profile (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)

- Avatar section with AI-generated profile backdrop
- Clean info cards with Wise-style sections
- Settings toggles with smooth animations
- Connected services section with status indicators

### Discover (`app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`)

- Hero section with AI-generated fitness imagery
- Category pills (Workouts, Nutrition, Recovery, Mindset)
- Content cards with thumbnails and descriptions
- Quick tips carousel

### Auth Screens (`app/(auth)/`)

- Full redesign with teal gradient backgrounds
- Clean input fields with floating labels
- Smooth transitions between sign-in/sign-up

---

## Phase 4: AI Image Integration

### Implementation in Convex

Add new action in `convex/actions/imageGeneration.ts` using Google Gemini image generation for:

- Decorative background patterns
- Screen header illustrations
- Achievement celebration imagery

### Caching Strategy

Store generated images in Convex file storage with metadata for reuse.

---

## Phase 5: Animations and Polish

- Entry animations using `react-native-reanimated` (staggered reveals)
- Press feedback with scale animations on all interactive elements
- Pull-to-refresh with custom teal indicator
- Screen transitions with shared element animations
- Loading skeletons matching final card layouts

---

## Key Dependencies to Add

```json
{
  "@expo-google-fonts/dm-sans": "^0.2.3",
  "@expo-google-fonts/archivo": "^0.2.3",
  "react-native-svg": "^15.0.0",
